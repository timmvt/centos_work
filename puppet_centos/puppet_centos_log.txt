		    Commands used:
		    sudo yum install mariadb-server

	    	    sudo /usr/bin/
			OK, successfully used password, moving on...

			Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB root user without the proper authorisation.

			Set root password? [Y/n] Y
			New password: 
			Re-enter new password: 
			Password updated successfully!
			Reloading privilege tables..
			 ... Success!

			By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a production environment.

			Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
			 ... Success!

			Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

			Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
			 ... Success!

			By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed before moving into a production environment.

			Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
			 - Dropping test database...
			 ... Success!
			 - Removing privileges on test database...
			 ... Success!

			Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far will take effect immediately.

			Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y	
			 ... Success!

			Cleaning up...

			All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB installation should now be secure.

			Thanks for using MariaDB!
