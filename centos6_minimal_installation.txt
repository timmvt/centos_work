Steps to install on VirtualBox:
(1) Get CentOS 6 from repository. http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/6/isos/x86_64/
	(a) Place the downloaded file where you would like it to exist.

(2) From VirtualBox,
	(a) click 'New'.
	(b) provide a descriptive name, Type: Linux, Version: Red Hat 64-bit.
	(c) allocate memory.
	(d) Select 'Create a virtual hard drive now' and then 'Create'.
	(e) Select '.vdi' [VirtualBox Disk Image].
	(f) Select 'Dynamically allocated'.
	(g) Select the amount of disk space you want.
	(h) Create.

(3) Once created, select your newly created installation. Click 'Settings'. When the Settings window opens:
	(a) Select the 'Storage' tab
	(b) Under 'Controller', select 'Empty and then the disc icon.
	(c) Select 'Choose a CD/DVD file'. A new window will open. Navigate to where you downloaded the file.
	(d) Click 'OK'.
	
(4) Run the instance.

(5) When the VM starts up, everything is done via the CLI.

(6) I set up the network first to get the Gnome Desktop Manager (gdm). 
	(a) [root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
		The line ONBOOT=no needs to be changed to ONBOOT=yes
	(b) [root@localhost ~]# vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
		Change ONBOOT=no to ONBOOT=yes
	(c) [root@localhost ~]# service network restart

(7) Installing the GDM
	[root@localhost ~]# yum groupinstall "Desktop" "Desktop Platform" "X Window System" "Fonts"
	Make a cup of tea and watch :)

(8) Adding a user (on the CLI)
	(a) adduser <username>
	(b) passwd <username> 

(9) Add user to the sudoers file
	(a) sudo adduser <username> sudo

(10) log into <username> account
	(a) In order to get the GDM GUI working on every boot, type the following:
		'sudo vi /etc/inittab'
	(b) Change the following line:
		id:3:initdefault:
	    TO 
		id:5:initdefault:

(11) Reboot and enjoy :)
