2015-02-23 08:42 -> Installed CentOS 7.0 on Virtualbox. After installation on VB, removed the IDE controller file under Storage tab. This is to prevent the installation disk from starting up every time the machine is booted.

           09:17 -> Installing puppet, puppet-server, git, VirtualBox via command line. For details: see below:
		    PUPPET:
		    #sudo yum install puppet
         		#sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
		    #sudo yum install puppet-server
		    GIT:
		    #sudo yum install git
		    VIRTUALBOX: [source: http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Virtualization/VirtualBox]
		    need to add virtualbox repository:
			#cd /etc/yum/repos.d
			#sudo wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/rhel/virtualbox.repo
		    need to add rpmforge:
			#sudo yum install rpmforge (ended up using the software center because though the file was in the repo directory, the file could not be found per command line message: sudo wget http://pkgs.repoforge.org/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.e17.rf.x86_64.rpm)
		    #sudo yum --enablerepo rpmforge install dkms (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) 
		    #sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
		    #sudo yum install kernel-devel
		    #sudo yum install VirtualBox-4.1
		    
      	   11:21 -> Configuring git

	   12:04 -> Added SSH key to github account. Everythings working smoothly so far! :)

	   12:17 -> working on puppet + centos (prior puppet work was puppet + ubuntu)
	   13:45 -> Vagrant installed

           13:54 -> Puppet 3 by John Arenlund started -- ALL WORK on puppet_centos_log.txt

2015-02-24 13:47 -> Work on installing and exploring Katello [SOURCE: https://github.com/Katello/katello-deploy/blob/master/README.md]
		    
		    Ensure you have Vagrant installed
		        For libvirt:
		            Ensure you have the prerequisites installed sudo yum install ruby rubygems gcc
		            Vagrant 1.6.5+ can be downloaded and installed from Vagrant Downloads
		        For Virtualbox, Vagrant 1.6.5+ can be downloaded and installed from Vagrant Downloads
		    Clone this repository - git clone https://github.com/Katello/katello-deploy.git
		    Enter the repository - cd katello-deploy

		    Install libvirt. On CentOS/Fedora/RHEL, run sudo yum install @virtualization libvirt-devel
		    Install the libvirt plugin for Vagrant (see vagrant-libvirt page for more information) vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt --plugin-version 0.0.20
		    Make sure your user is in the qemu group. (e.g. [[ ! "$(groups $(whoami))" =~ "qemu" ]] && sudo usermod -aG qemu $(whoami))
		    Set the libvirt environment variable in your .bashrc or for your current session - export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=libvirt

		    According to https://github.com/pradels/vagrant-libvirt#installation, Fedora, Red Hat and CentOS need the following code to makr libvert-devel work due to problems building nokogiri and ruby libvert gem.
 		    yum install libxslt-devel libxml2-devel libvert-devel

	   14:54 -> Updated system time and date because it was interfering with github's schedule. Onwards with Katello.
